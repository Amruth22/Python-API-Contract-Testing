### Question 4: Mock Service
What is the primary purpose of a mock service in testing?

A) To replace the production database  
B) To simulate API responses for testing without depending on the actual service  
C) To improve API performance  
D) To encrypt test data  

**Answer: B**

---

### Question 5: JSON Schema
What does JSON Schema define?

A) How to write JSON files  
B) The structure, data types, and validation rules for JSON data  
C) JSON file compression  
D) JSON encryption methods  

**Answer: B**

### Question 6: Schema Validation
Why is schema validation important in APIs?

A) To make APIs faster  
B) To ensure data conforms to expected structure and prevent invalid data from causing errors  
C) To reduce code size  
D) To improve database performance  

**Answer: B**

---

### Question 7: Breaking Change
What is a breaking change in an API?

A) A bug fix  
B) A change that breaks existing consumers, such as removing a field or changing response structure  
C) Adding a new optional field  
D) Improving performance  

**Answer: B**

---

### Question 8: OpenAPI Specification
What is OpenAPI (formerly Swagger)?

A) A programming language  
B) A standard specification format for describing RESTful APIs  
C) A database system  
D) A testing framework  

**Answer: B**

---

### Question 9: Request Validation
When should you validate API requests?

A) Never, trust all input  
B) At the API boundary before processing to ensure data meets requirements  
C) Only in production  
D) Only for POST requests  

**Answer: B**

---

### Question 10: Mock vs Stub
What is the difference between a mock and a stub?

A) There is no difference  
B) Mocks verify interactions and behavior, stubs just provide canned responses  
C) Mocks are faster than stubs  
D) Stubs are only for databases  

**Answer: B**

---

### Question 11: Contract Versioning
Why is contract versioning important?

A) To make APIs faster  
B) To manage API evolution and maintain backward compatibility while allowing changes  
C) To reduce server costs  
D) Versioning is not important  

**Answer: B**

---

### Question 12: Response Schema Validation
What should you do if an API response doesn't match its schema?

A) Ignore it  
B) Log the error, fail the test, and investigate the mismatch  
C) Change the schema to match the response  
D) Restart the server  

**Answer: B**

---

### Question 13: Provider Testing
In contract testing, what does the provider need to verify?

A) That consumers are using the API correctly  
B) That it can satisfy all contracts defined by its consumers  
C) That the database is optimized  
D) That the network is fast  

**Answer: B**

---

### Question 14: Documentation Drift
What is documentation drift?

A) Moving documentation to a different server  
B) When API documentation becomes outdated and no longer matches the actual implementation  
C) Translating documentation to other languages  
D) Compressing documentation files  

**Answer: B**

---

### Question 15: Contract Test Automation
Why should contract tests be automated?

A) Automation is always better  
B) To continuously verify API compatibility and catch breaking changes early in development  
C) To reduce the number of developers needed  
D) Automated tests are faster to write  

**Answer: B**
